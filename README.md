# Tinder with Chuck Norris version 2

Assignment 2 for CPMDWithF course by Abdulayev Damir

## App description

The application will allow you to view Chuck Norris jokes generated by the "api.chucknorris.io" API. You can click on the heart button if you like the joke. (If you don't like it, then you're lying, who doesn't like Chuck Norris?) You can also swipe left or right to like a joke. In the lower left corner you see a button that opens a pop-up window with my personal information.

In the second version, I added an "Add to Favorites" button that will allow you to save the joke in a separate window. All jokes are stored in connected Firebase. It is also used Crashlytics for error analysis. In general, the design has changed for the better.
